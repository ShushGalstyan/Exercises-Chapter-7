//(Craps Game Modification) Modify the program of Fig. 6.11 to play 1000 games of craps. The program should keep track of the statistics and answer the following questions: a) How many games are won on the 1 st roll, 2 nd roll, ..., 20 th roll, and after the 20 th roll? b) How many games are lost on the 1 st roll, 2 nd roll, ..., 20 th roll, and after the 20 th roll? c) What are the chances of winning at craps? [Note: You should discover that craps is one  of the fairest casino games. What do you suppose this means?] d) Whatâ€™s the average length of a game of craps? e) Do the chances of winning improve with the length of the game?
